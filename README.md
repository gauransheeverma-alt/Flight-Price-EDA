# ✈️ Flight Price EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores flight price data to understand the factors that influence airline ticket pricing. Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, it identifies patterns, relationships, and trends in flight fares based on attributes such as airline, source, destination, duration, number of stops, and time of travel.

The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights that can help in **price prediction**, **market analysis**, and **decision-making** for both passengers and airline companies.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains detailed information about various flights and their corresponding prices.  
**Key features include:**
- **Airline:** Name of the airline company  
- **Date_of_Journey:** Date of flight  
- **Source:** City of departure  
- **Destination:** Arrival city  
- **Route:** Complete path of the journey  
- **Dep_Time:** Departure time  
- **Arrival_Time:** Arrival time  
- **Duration:** Total travel time  
- **Total_Stops:** Number of stops between source and destination  
- **Price:** Ticket price (target variable)

## 🧠 Project Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Analyze relationships between flight attributes and prices  
- Visualize trends using graphs and charts  
- Identify key factors affecting flight pricing  
- Generate insights for predictive modeling

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical analysis  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Plotly** – Interactive plots  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Direct flights are generally more expensive than those with stops  
- Premium airlines tend to have higher prices than budget carriers  
- Flight duration and departure time significantly affect pricing  
- Prices vary seasonally and by route demand
